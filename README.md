Data, analytics, and visualizations. These three elements are at the core of storytelling.

## Data

Why do we use data?

First try!

### Trial and Error

```txt
Ever tried.
Ever failed.
No matter.
Try again.
Fail again.
Fail better.
- Samuel Beckett
```

## A Picture is Worth Thousand Words

And often several hundred too many!

### Volume of Information

Sometimes it depends on the audience. Sometimes it's the visual.

## Storytelling

Stories need narrative, background, and a connection to an audience for the message to be relatable. Clear and understandable in a short span.

### Chapters

Show different parts of your stories separately is effective. Events happen separately!

Dashboards, separators, text boxes can all help differentiate different sections of information.
